# gpuMemoryTracking
Concurrency Final Project 2018 to track memory references of CUDA kernels

# Limitations
This project relies on SASSI, found [here](https://github.com/NVlabs/SASSI). As of writing this, SASSI is dependent on CUDA 7, which may have compatibility with new Linux distributions such as Xenial.
